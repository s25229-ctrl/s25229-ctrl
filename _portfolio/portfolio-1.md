This is my project that i made with my teammates, Ethan and Jian Feng. It is a smart, IOT, air purifier and hub that links up your smart home (preferibly Home Assistant on Rasberry pi) to make your home in the most non-congested place for lungs and health.

The CMS is a powerful, yet compact air purifier that keeps your in the cleanest, allowing portability wherever you go. Ready to take it up a notch, upgrade this capable air purifier with a smart home kit and sensing capabilities. This air purifier can now unlock smart home with Rasberry pi's very own Home Assistant, acessing IOT sensors and intergrated commands, making this a simplistic and importantly, easy to use experience. Also, we can't forget the sensors imbeded into the module itself. Inside the module, bost a gas sensor to detect harmful gasses and buzzer. With this setup put together, the CMS can now do complicated tasks like increasing intake if levels get worse, AI detection and recommendations, alarm of bad air quality, graph quality, and even in the future, a full fledge Chat-GPT based AI. The posibilities are endless.

Now, lets talk about the main purifier itself. The CMS is equipped with three layers of filtration that are crucial to the cleanliness of the air, Hepa filter, carbon filter and dust filter. As well with a powerfil fan that sucks all the bad air and blow out all the good air.
